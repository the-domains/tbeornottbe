In recent years, the rise in championship-level UK boxers has been nothing short of meteoric. Saving the memorable early nineties, I cannot find the UK boxing scene any healthier. 

After a certain (and impressive) debut recently, we even have a new Benn and Eubank 2.0 that we can enjoy as they mature. Perhaps you are needing to get up to date on your British fighters, or the boxing scene at large. Maybe you are merely here by chance. However you arrived, this series of posts will focus on one UK boxing prospect each week that we feel you should keep your eyes on. 

**Sidenote:** there is no shortage of noteworthy fighters hailing from other countries. I will touch upon some of the best within the weight classes of any Britons we discuss over the coming weeks and months.
