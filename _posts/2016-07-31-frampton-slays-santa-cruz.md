Carl Frampton became an elite member of the boxing fraternity in the early hours of Sunday morning on the 31st of July. 

Driven by the desire to emulate the achievement of his trainer, Frampton still possessed the wherewithal to read the situation and box intelligently. It reminded me very much of the raiding style that brought Pacquiao into very great acclaim over the last decade. It felt reminiscent of seeing Pac dancing past the longer levers of much bigger opposition to score. 

No one came out of this fight with anything less than high praise, but I do think that when Leo watches the fight back he will see that he was simply out-thought by Frampton. In credit to both of the fighters the referee could have gone to the wrong venue tonight and he would not have been missed. People who tune in to watch fights can wait their entire lifetime to see a fight so evenly and competitively contested. Take note, Mr. Mayweather: this is the truest expression of pugilism. 

I believe that the two judges who had it wide were valid. I think that Frampton did the cleaner and more effective work that edged almost all of the close rounds. Leo had three rounds that I could clearly give him and even then you could argue that two of those could have been Frampton's, or scored equally. 

The most telling aspect was that Santa Cruz was unable to impose his style of fighting because every time he let his hands go with some consistency, there was either the threat of being punished, or the punishment. This is a testament to the work ethic of Frampton who is clearly a marquee fighter who brings his very best whenever he is considered an underdog. 

The British boxing Renaissance continues to blossom marvelously and moreover, Frampton has elevated himself to a seat on the very top table.

Not without considerable mention is Shane Mcguigan who has shown himself to be a very adept trainer at such a young age, and Barry Mcguigan, who has transitioned from a great boxer in his own regard to a promoter and manager who understands his fighters excellently. 

What did you think?
